# Marble Blast Gold Unity Port

The unity port of the classic game Marble Blast Gold, with the most accurate physics (although not identical). This project started from CyberFox's [MarblePhysics Unity](https://github.com/CyberFoxHax/MarblePhysicsUnity) that already has a faithful marble movement physics, then continued with codes based on [Marble Blast Web Port](https://github.com/Vanilagy/MarbleBlast) and [Marble Blast Haxe Port](https://github.com/RandomityGuy/MBHaxe/). The Unity version used is Unity 2022.3.62f3. Note that this version of the Narble Blast Gold Unity Port does not implement Traplaunches.

As the time of me writing this, the game has not been fully tested as I don't have the skill and capability to complete all levels.

## Download the Windows build [here](https://github.com/NaCl586/mbg-unity-revisited/releases/tag/1.0)

If you find bugs or things that are not faithful with the original Marble Blast Gold, feel free to message me on discord NaCl586#8479.

Special thanks to Vani and RandomityGuy that I banged whenever I have problems when making this project.
